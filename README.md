# ✨ SkillHub — The Ultimate Modular Learning & Quiz Platform

SkillHub is a feature-rich, scalable, and maintainable learning platform that combines a modular NestJS backend (following Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture) with a powerful Angular frontend. More than just a quiz app — SkillHub is an ecosystem designed for education, gamification, and intelligent assessment.

- ✅ Create and share multiple-choice or open-ended quizzes
- 👥 Organize participants into groups and send invitations
- 🧠 Track participation, auto-score responses, and rank users
- 📈 Monitor real-time system health and user interactions
- 🧩 Scale seamlessly with a modular backend and modern SPA frontend

## 📊 Backend Architecture (NestJS + Clean Architecture)

```
Presentation Layer   -> Controllers (HTTP routes)
Application Layer    -> Use Cases (business logic, orchestration)
Domain Layer         -> Entities, Value Objects, Interfaces
Infrastructure Layer -> Repositories, DB adapters, external APIs
```

Each domain (e.g., `auth`, `quizzes`, `groups`) is a bounded context that is isolated, testable, and optionally deployable as a microservice.

**Suggested Folder Structure:**

```
skillhub-backend/
├── apps/                     # Entry points (API Gateway, etc.)
├── libs/                     # Shared code (DTOs, utils, auth, etc.)
└── services/
    ├── auth/
    │   ├── application/
    │   ├── domain/
    │   ├── infrastructure/
    │   └── presentation/
    ├── quizzes/
    ├── groups/
    └── ...
```

## 🎨 Frontend Architecture (Angular - Feature-Based)

```
src/app/
├── core/         → Global services, interceptors, guards
├── shared/       → UI components, directives, pipes
├── auth/         → Login / Register
├── quizzes/      → Quiz participation
├── quiz-admin/   → Create & edit quizzes
├── groups/       → Group management & invitations
├── dashboard/    → Leaderboards, progress, analytics
```

## 📃 Database Design

| Module       | Database   | Why                                                         |
|--------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Auth         | PostgreSQL | Structured relational data (users, roles, sessions)         |
| Quizzes      | MongoDB    | Flexible schema for nested questions and options            |
| Submissions  | MongoDB    | Fast writes and storage of user answers                     |
| Leaderboard  | Redis      | Quick access with TTL support for ranking and caching       |

---

## ⚡ Redis Caching Strategy

Optimized caching for:

- Public quizzes → `quiz:{id}`
- Group dashboards → `group:{id}:leaderboard`
- User profiles → `user:{id}`

Auto-expiry using TTL and cache invalidation on updates.

---

## 📦 Logging Pipeline

- JSON logs via **Winston**
- Stored locally in `logs/app.log`
- Sent to **Elasticsearch** via **Filebeat**
- Visualized in **Kibana**

Monitor:

- 🔄 Request count per endpoint
- 🚨 Errors by service
- 🧍 Active users and interaction heatmaps

---

## 📊 Monitoring Stack

Each microservice exposes `/metrics` (via Prometheus module)

| Tool        | Purpose                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Prometheus  | Metrics scraping               |
| Grafana     | Dashboards for:                |
|             | - Service uptime               |
|             | - Error rate                   |
|             | - Response latency             |
|             | - User traffic patterns        |

---

## ☘️ Deployment Strategy

| Environment | Tool            | Notes                                      |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Dev         | Docker Compose   | Local multi-service development stack      |
| Prod        | Kubernetes       | Scalable with Helm, Ingress, and secrets   |

```
deployment/
├── docker-compose/
└── k8s/
    ├── base/
    ├── secrets/
    └── ingress.yaml
```

## 🔧 Suggested Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

- 🧠 **Nx Monorepo**: Manage NestJS + Angular in one workspace with caching, generators, and graph-aware CI.
- 📬 **Domain Events**: Use Kafka for decoupled, async events (quiz completion, notifications, analytics).
- 🔐 **Advanced Security**: 2FA, bcrypt, audit logs, and Helmet.
- 🧪 **Testing**: Add unit, integration, and E2E tests (e.g., Jest, Cypress).
- 🚀 **CI/CD**: Automate using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
- 📡 **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing across services in Kubernetes.
- 📊 **Load Testing**: Validate system performance with k6 or Locust.
- 🌐 **Micro-Frontends**: Consider for large teams with independent deployments (Angular Module Federation).
